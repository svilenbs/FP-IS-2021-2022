import Data.List
-- instance Eq for Tree, how to define it?

{-- 
Define a new data type called "Shape". Shape must have four constructors:
Circle: with one argument representing the radius;
Rectangle: with two arguments representing the width and height;
Triangle - defined by 3 sides;
Cylinder with two arguments for the radius of the base and height.
Create a shape from every type and output it.
--}

-- Define is2D object return information if the Shape is 2d object.
-- Define function area for Shape objects

-- Graphs...
-- by defined graph find is there direct path between 2 elemets in graph

Problem 80
(***) Conversions

Write predicates to convert between the different graph representations. With these predicates, all representations are equivalent; i.e. for the following problems you can always pick freely the most convenient form. The reason this problem is rated (***) is not because it's particularly difficult, but because it's a lot of work to deal with all the special cases.

Example in Haskell:

Î»> graphToAdj Graph ['b','c','d','f','g','h','k'] [('b','c'),('b','f'),('c','f'),('f','k'),('g','h')]
Adj [('b', "cf"), ('c', "bf"), ('d', ""), ('f', "bck"), ('g', "h"), ('h', "g"), ('k', "f")]
